# Plan.md - Detailed Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview

**Vision**: Build an AI-native business platform starting with a CRM workflow that leverages transformer-based AI models for zero manual data entry, proactive insights, and fully conversational interactions.

## Key Capabilities

1. **Automatic Data Capture**
   - Extract structured data from conversational interactions (voice, chat, email).
   - Proactively infer and populate CRM fields (company name, contact, deal stage, follow-ups).

2. **Conversational Interface**
   - Users interact exclusively via conversational UI (chat/voice).
   - AI interprets natural language to execute commands (e.g., update deal status, send follow-up reminders).

3. **Adaptive Business Workflow**
   - AI dynamically learns and evolves workflows based on user behaviors.
   - Proactive suggestions for optimizing workflows based on performance data.

4. **Proactive Insights and Recommendations**
   - AI actively monitors deal progress, suggests follow-ups, and identifies pipeline risks.
   - Push-based insights (alerts) on critical events or opportunities.

5. **Explainability and Transparency**
   - AI clearly explains its actions and reasoning to build trust.
   - Users can easily correct or refine AI actions via conversational interaction.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components

- **API Layer (FastAPI)**:
  - Handles incoming conversational interactions (JSON payloads from UI).
  - Serves as the primary orchestration layer.

- **Data Layer (PostgreSQL)**:
  - Structured storage of CRM data (contacts, companies, deal stages, notes, tasks).
  - Managed schema optimized for frequent read/write operations and querying.

- **Vector Store (Pinecone or FAISS)**:
  - Semantic storage and retrieval for contextual conversational recall.

- **AI Model Layer**:
  - **LLM (Anthropic Claude 3 / GPT-4-turbo)**: Conversational interactions, summarization, insights generation.
  - **Speech-to-Text (Whisper API)**: Transcribe voice interactions.
  - **Embedding Models (OpenAI embeddings)**: Semantic similarity search for relevant past interactions.
  - **NER & Classification Models (spaCy or GPT-4 fine-tuned)**: Structured data extraction from conversations.

### Frontend Components

- **Conversational UI (React + Next.js)**:
  - Single interface supporting text/voice inputs.
  - Streamlined interface presenting AI-driven insights, deal statuses, alerts.
  - Visualization of deal pipeline and customer insights.

- **Real-time Notifications (WebSockets)**:
  - Push-based real-time insights/alerts directly to user interface.

## Workflow Example

- User conversation input: "Just talked to Bill from Databricks, wants a proposal."
- **Automatic processing**:
  - Extract entities ("Bill", "Databricks", "Proposal Stage").
  - Update CRM record (move deal from "Demo" to "Proposal").
  - Generate proactive suggestion ("Send proposal template to Bill?").
- User response: "Yes, send standard proposal."
  - AI auto-generates proposal email and sends it.
  - Logs action and updates structured data automatically.

## Accuracy and Error Handling

- **Confidence Thresholds**: Clearly indicate when AI confidence is low, prompting human validation.
- **Explainability**: All AI actions can be explained via conversational queries ("Why did you move this deal to Proposal?").

## Metrics and Monitoring

- Accuracy metrics for data capture and entity extraction.
- User engagement and productivity improvements.
- Adoption and retention rate.

## Milestones

### MVP
- Conversational UI, automatic structured data capture.
- Basic pipeline visualization.
- Core workflow inference and adjustment.

### V1 Enhancements
- Full voice interaction.
- Advanced proactive insights and alerts.
- Enhanced adaptive workflow learning and optimization.

## Deployment

- Cloud-native architecture (AWS / GCP): Kubernetes for service orchestration.
- CI/CD pipeline for fast iteration and deployment.
- Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana) for observability and troubleshooting.
